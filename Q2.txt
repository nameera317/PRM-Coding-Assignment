Q2. A student will not be allowed to sit in the exam if his/her attendance is less than 75%. if he/she has medical causes reduce attendance
    criteria to 60%. Ask the user if he/she has a medical cause or not ( 'Y' or 'N' ) and print accordingly. You were given a total no classes 
    and total classes attended by the student.
   
    var attendClasses = 150;
    var totalClasses = 250;
    var str = 'Y'

    var attend = (attendClasses/totalClasses)*100;
 
    if(attend < 75 && str == 'N'){
     console.log('false')
    }
    else if(attend < 60 && str == 'Y'){
     console.log('false')
    }
    else {
     console.log('True')
    }
